##Project Description:

To Be Delivered aims to be a hybrid of locally hosting a personal storage server and a cloud storage solution. This is done to provide the convenience of using a cloud storage service while protecting user privacy. User privacy is important because it is a fundamental right, and users should be able to easily transfer files between their devices without anyone being able to look at them. This is done by encrypting files before they are sent (only the user has the key) which means even if the files are intercepted, their contents will be unreadable to anyone except the owner. The goal of To Be Delivered (TBD) is to give users the privacy offered by hosting a personal storage server and be as easy to set up as a cloud storage service. This is achieved by utilizing both a cloud computer and a storage computer (owned by the user) to store files. Files uploaded to the service are temporarily held in the cloud computer until the storage computer has fully downloaded the file. Additionally, files are automatically encrypted before they are sent using a key only the user has access to (users are responsible for safeguarding and copying it to their other devices). The file will then be automatically decrypted on the userâ€™s computer once it receives it (assuming the user has given the key to their device once).

##Technology:

TBD is developed using VScode, Python programming language, Github, and PyQt5.
Current State of TBD: TBD is currently undergoing construction in its early stages of development. TBD is currently focusing on updating the UI along with adding security features to protect user privacy.
